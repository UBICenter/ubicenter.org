###### Pro-UBI arguments include its potential to improve upon the current safety net (especially given concerns about technological unemployment), and the positive effects of UBI-like programs.

<h3> UBI could address issues with the existing safety net </h3>
<br>
<h6>Ends poverty</h6>
The most simple, rudimentary case for a universal basic income is the same case for most aspects of the welfare state: Though markets are efficient at generating wealth, not everyone earns enough money to live out of poverty, so poverty reduction requires state assistance. The elderly, disabled, children, and students account for 86% of [those]( https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2018/09/18/the-best-way-to-eradicate-poverty-welfare-not-jobs/) without jobs in the U.S.. Increasing market income can reduce poverty, but it cannot eliminate it.

[Years](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28556/w28556.pdf) [of](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-7679.2006.00346.x) [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6145823/#:~:text=As%20it%20does%20for%20all,poverty%20by%20nearly%2050%20percent)
 have found that unconditional cash transfers are an effective mechanism of reducing poverty. America is far stingier with cash transfers than other developed nations, which causes a significantly smaller reduction in post-tax-and-transfer income inequality.

<h6>Runs efficiently</h6>
Programs like SNAP and housing vouchers cost about 10 percent in overhead, and cost recipients time applying and complying. UBI would likely cost less than 1% and involve little to no burden on recipients.

<h6>Aligns incentives</h6>
Means-tested benefits often create large marginal tax rates, including cliffs where recipients are better off not working. Under a UBI, each dollar earned raises disposable income.

<h6>Technological unemployment could widen the gap between UBI and current programs</h6>
Advocates argue that today's safety net is built for temporary spells of unemployment, not an economy where workers need constant retraining, and call for UBI as insurance to help people adapt to a changing economy.

<h3> Safety nets already include elements of UBI </h3>
UBI is fundamentally about creating an inclusive, cash-oriented safety net. Many safety net programs incorporate these features.
<br>
<h6>Refundable tax credits lift millions of Americans out of poverty</h6>
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC) are cash antipoverty tools with bipartisan support. The 2017 Republican tax cut expanded the CTC, while Democrats have proposed a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/6/18249290/child-poverty-american-family-act-sherrod-brown-michael-bennet" target="_blank">nearly-universal child allowance</a>. Democrats have also introduced the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/12/18661492/rashida-tlaib-basic-income-cash-earned-income-tax-credit" target="_blank">LIFT+ Act</a>, which would expand the EITC to families with low or no earnings, and both parties have called for expanding EITC for childless workers.

<h6>Alaska has had a small UBI for decades</h6>
Alaska's Permanent Fund, which invests the state's oil revenues, pays out a share of interest to each Alaskan. The Permanent Fund Dividend has ranged from $1,000 to $3,000 per person per year since its introduction in 1982.

[Berman and Reamey (2016)](https://iseralaska.org/static/legacy_publication_links/presentations/2016_10_18-AlaskaPFDPoverty.pdf){:target="_blank"} estimate that the program has reduced Alaska's poverty by 20 percent, and [Jones and Marinescu (2018)](https://home.uchicago.edu/~j1s/Jones_Alaska.pdf){:target="_blank"} estimate that it has "had no effect on employment, and increased part-time work by 1.8 percentage points (17 percent)." [A 2017 survey](https://www.scribd.com/document/352375988/ESP-Alaska-PFD-Phone-Survey-Executive-Summary-Spring-2017){:target="_blank"} found that 78 percent of Alaskans view the program favorably. 

<h6>Many developed countries have cash benefits for children</h6>
Canada and most European countries give child allowances, and [Ireland](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html) and [Sweden](https://www.forsakringskassan.se/english){:target="_blank"} give flat amounts for every child--a true UBI for children

<h3> Cash transfers improve a large set of outcomes </h3>
High-quality evidence, including randomized controlled trials, and spanning low- and high-income countries, have shown that cash transfers
