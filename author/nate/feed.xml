      <content type="html" xml:base="/us-mothers-day">&lt;p&gt;52 million mothers in the United States live with their children.
Of those, over 4.5 million are in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That poverty rate of 9.0 percent is a bit lower than the overall poverty rate of 9.3 percent,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:spm&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:spm&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; largely thanks to safety net programs that target families with children.
Yet, many of those programs fail to reach low-income mothers due to qualification rules and complex bureaucracies.
For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tcf.org/content/report/what-a-child-allowance-like-canadas-would-do-for-child-poverty-in-america/?session=1&quot;&gt;70 percent of single moms do not receive the full Child Tax Credit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simpler alternative, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/policies.html#other-countries&quot;&gt;other countries adopt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubicenter.org/tag/child-allowance/&quot;&gt;which we’ve written about in several other reports&lt;/a&gt;, is a universal child allowance: a flat amount given each month to parents for each of their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While child allowances chiefly reduce child poverty, they also lift mothers out of poverty.
For example, a $200 per month child allowance would lift one million mothers out of poverty, at an annual cost of $173 billion.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:funding&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:funding&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#graph_graph_5_1&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/us-mothers-day-2022/graph_5_1.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;graph_graph_5_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#graph_graph_5_2&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/us-mothers-day-2022/graph_5_2.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;graph_graph_5_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Child allowances would cut maternal poverty at similar relative rates across states.
For example, a $200 monthly child allowance would cut it by about 15 percent in both California and Maryland.
In California, the policy would cost $21 billion per year and lift 114,000 mothers out of poverty, while in Maryland, it would cost $3.1 billion per year and lift 16,000 mothers out of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#graph_graph_7_1&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/us-mothers-day-2022/graph_7_1.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;graph_graph_7_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maternal poverty is associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-8624.00379&quot;&gt;depression and worsened child development&lt;/a&gt;.
Mothers spend about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/charts/american-time-use/activity-by-parent.htm&quot;&gt;1.7 hours per day&lt;/a&gt; caring for children.
And of course, mothers suffer from the consequences of poverty like any other person does.
Child allowances can improve child outcomes, compensate parents for raising the next generation, and improve the well-being of moms everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link href="/omar-support-act" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ilhan Omar's Near-UBI Guaranteed Income Bill" />
      <published>2021-08-02T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2021-08-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/omar-support-act</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/omar-support-act">&lt;p&gt;On Friday, July 30, Representative Ilhan Omar &lt;a href=&quot;https://omar.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-omar-introduces-guaranteed-income-bill-and-gdp-alternative-legislation&quot;&gt;introduced the SUPPORT Act of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which would commit the US to studying and eventually implementing a national guaranteed income. The first phase of the bill would provide an annual $500 million in grants to fund and evaluate local guaranteed income pilot programs. In 2028, the bill would establish the Guaranteed Income Tax Credit (GITC), which would create an income floor across the entire United States. This paper describes the GITC’s structure and estimates its budgetary and distributional impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-support-acts-guaranteed-income-tax-credit&quot;&gt;The SUPPORT Act’s Guaranteed Income Tax Credit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2028, the GITC would provide $1,200 per month for single filers and $2,400 for joint filers; it would also provide $600 per month for each dependent under age 18, but none for adult dependents like college students.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Tax filers with adjusted gross income (AGI) above $75,000 ($112,500 for heads of household, $150,000 for joint filers) would have their annual payment reduced by $5 per $100 of AGI in excess of those thresholds. For example, a single childless adult with income of $100,000 would receive ($1,200 * 12) - (5% * $25,000) = $14,400 - $1,250 = $13,150.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#graph_graph_5_1&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/omar-support-act/graph_5_1.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;graph_graph_5_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#graph_graph_5_2&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/omar-support-act/graph_5_2.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;graph_graph_5_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 5% phase-out rate is significantly lower than other guaranteed income proposals, such as the New School’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UDFPwUYu2Rf4RGgXuOTacmBj2Gt9paAV/view&quot;&gt;Guaranteed Income for the 21st Century&lt;/a&gt;. Lower phase-out rates avoids stark work disincentives, as benefit phase-outs operate identically to marginal tax rates; the GITC in effect levies a new 5% marginal tax rate on filers with income in the phase-out region. It also makes the bill similar to a full universal basic income; for example, married filers with at least two children would receive at least some of the GITC even with income above $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simulating the policy with the 2019 Current Population Survey, we found that the GITC would cost $3.75 trillion per year if implemented today.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Because the payments phase out slowly starting at relatively high incomes, 99.6% of people live in a family that will receive a payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program would, for all intents and purposes, eliminate poverty, reducing the poverty rate by 96% and deep poverty by 98%, with larger effects for children. Two in three people still in poverty after the program are in families with negative current resources, a scenario typically associated with business losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#graph_graph_12_1&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/omar-support-act/graph_12_1.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;graph_graph_12_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GITC would also reduce inequality. The income share held by the top 10% would fall by 21%, and the income share held by the top 1% would fall by 29%. The Gini index, a broader measure of inequality, would fall 24%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#graph_graph_14_1&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/omar-support-act/graph_14_1.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;graph_graph_14_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2019, the Guaranteed Income Tax Credit would cost about a fifth of GDP, nearly doubling the federal budget. By 2028, however, the Congressional Budget Office &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57339&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; that GDP will be more than 40% higher than it was in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/gross-domestic-product-fourth-quarter-and-year-2019-advance-estimate&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, and federal revenues will be more than 50% higher. Since the phase-out thresholds are set in nominal terms, the budgetary impact would be somewhat smaller in 2028 than our estimates suggest; nevertheless, it would be very costly, and without funding provisions, our distributional analysis is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing a generous benefit without any work requirement or phase-in, the GITC would virtually end poverty. If the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubicenter.org/advance-ctc&quot;&gt;monthly Child Tax Credit&lt;/a&gt; is any indication, though, operating the program through the tax code threatens its ability to reach the poorest families who don’t normally file taxes. Making the GITC universal would enable it to operate outside the tax code, such as through the Social Security Administration (like &lt;a href=&quot;ubicenter.org/family-security-act&quot;&gt;Senator Mitt Romney’s child allowance proposal&lt;/a&gt;) which could bring it the higher accuracy of Social Security payments; universalizing the GITC would add 11% to its cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SUPPORT Act’s Guaranteed Income Tax Credit may be the closest legislation to universal basic income the US has seen. While many important details are as yet undefined, it could mark the beginning of a new conversation around basic income legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <published>2021-07-21T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2021-07-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/introducing-basic-income-builder">&lt;h1 id=&quot;try-the-basic-income-builder-at-bibubicenterorg&quot;&gt;Try the Basic Income Builder at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bib.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;bib.ubicenter.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Python and Plotly Dash’s dashboarding tools, we’ve created the Basic Income Builder: an interactive calculator that uses U.S. Census microdata to simulate distributional effects of a customizable UBI policy program. Users can experiment with a wide variety of inputs, from the size of the and type of taxation to reforms of the existing safety net programs. The calculator then produces interactive data visualizations that allow the user to explore the proposal’s effect on the poverty rate for selected demographics, the poverty gap, and an estimate of what share of individuals come out ahead. Read on for more information, or try it yourself at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bib.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;bib.ubicenter.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our recent research at the UBI Center has demonstrated the remarkable effectiveness of unconditional cash transfers in reducing poverty and inequality across different demographics and regions in the United States. We have found that the UBI shrinks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubicenter.org/how-universal-basic-income-would-affect-the-black-white-poverty-and-wealth-gaps&quot;&gt;racial poverty and wealth gaps&lt;/a&gt;, reduces poverty among &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubicenter.org/ada30&quot;&gt;people with disabilities&lt;/a&gt;, and is more progressive than cancelling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubicenter.org/student-debt&quot;&gt;student loan debt&lt;/a&gt; in terms of wealth inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by calculators such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://taxjusticenow.org/#/#makeYourOwnTaxPlan&quot;&gt;Tax Justice Now&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubicalculator.com/&quot;&gt;UBI Calculator&lt;/a&gt;, and PSL’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://compute.studio/PSLmodels/Tax-Brain/new/&quot;&gt;Tax Brain&lt;/a&gt;, and building on our prior work with the &lt;a href=&quot;plans.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;UBI Plan Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, we created Basic Income Builder, an interactive, customizable policy simulation tool built on our own research on UBI proposals. We sought to create a tool that is useful for policy analysts and policy makers at both the state and federal level, while yielding comprehensible results for a general audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our research has shown that funding Basic Income with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubicenter.org/us-flat-tax&quot;&gt;flat tax&lt;/a&gt; of 25% or more would reduce both poverty and inequality, we can create a funding mechanism that funds a robust UBI program, but does not require the user to create or adjust complicated income tax brackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All code powering this calculator is at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UBICenter/us-calc&quot;&gt;github.com/UBICenter/us-calc&lt;/a&gt;, and the app is hosted on the open source &lt;a href=&quot;http://compute.studio&quot;&gt;Compute Studio platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:hank&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:hank&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use three years of data (2017-2019) from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) of the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is a monthly survey of U.S. households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPS is conducted for the purposes of finding employment and earnings statistics of all individuals 15 and over in the household. Data is reported on the level of the individual persons in the household.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ASEC provides additional information such as after-tax money income and non-cash benefits. The ASEC also calculates the poverty thresholds for each unit used in our calculations. The ASEC includes all CPS survey respondents in March, with additional oversamples from other months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ASEC provides weighted individual and household level economic and demographic variables that we use to determine the total revenue impacts of our available tax, benefit, and eligibility criteria, as well as the impact on poverty and inequality for the entire population, and the impact on poverty rates for a number of selected demographics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use the Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) rather than the official poverty measure. The SPM resource measure is cash income plus in-kind benefits minus non discretionary expenses (including taxes, out of pocket health expenses, and work-related expenses). The SPM poverty thresholds are based on a core of annually updated core expenditures, adjusted for the size of the SPM resource unit and geographical variation in the cost of living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our simulation’s results with respect to poverty are calculated in terms of SPM resources, adjusted for the size of the UBI benefit, as well as any changes to the tax and benefit system selected by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SPM resource unit is a broadened definition of the traditional Census family of related individuals, expanded to include any cohabiters and their relatives who are likely to share resources. We use the Gini coefficient of SPM resources among SPM units as our primary inequality measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our data is limited in two primary ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The systematic underreporting of means-tested benefits in survey responses; depending on the benefit, up to half may be missing from the Current Population Survey (&lt;a href=&quot;https://harris.uchicago.edu/files/underreporting.pdf&quot;&gt;Meyer Mok and Sullivan 2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The underreporting of incomes above one million dollars, due to the Census Bureau’s income “top-coding” which intends to avoid disclosure of respondents’ personally identifiable data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;simulation&quot;&gt;Simulation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user does not select a UBI benefit amount directly – rather, the user selects from a number of budget-neutral “pay-fors”, which produces a benefit size as an output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the tax side, users can repeal the personal income tax and the employee-side payroll tax. In addition, there is a slider available for the user to select an additional flat tax of 0% to 50% on all adjusted gross income (AGI) above $0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the benefit side, the user can repeal the Child Tax Credit, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps), Earned Income Tax Credit, Unemployment Benefits, and the Low Income Heating and Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users may also select whether adults, children, and/or non-citizens are eligible for benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can describe our model as follows, where \(t\) is the additional tax rate (0% to 50%) on all AGI above $0 as selected by user and \(NT_i\) is the value of a new user-specified tax on AGI for SPM unit \(i\):&lt;/p&gt;

\[NT_i = t * \max(AGI_i, 0)\]

&lt;p&gt;RT is the value of SPM unit’s taxes paid that have been repealed by the user, where IT refers to income taxes paid and PT refers to employee-side payroll taxes. Where \(r_n\) represents a Boolean where a value of \(r_n=1\) indicates that the user has chosen to repeal the benefit, and \(r_n=0\) if not.&lt;/p&gt;

\[RT_i = r_{IT}IT_i + r_{PT}PT_i\]

&lt;p&gt;We define \(RB\) as the value of SPM unit’s benefits that have been repealed by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

\[RB_i = r_{CTC} * CTC_i + r_{SSI} * SSI_i + r_{SNAP} * SNAP_i + r_{EITC} * EITC_i + r_{UI} * UI_i + r_{LIHEAP} * LIHEAP_i\]

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the total revenue raised by the user is equal to:&lt;/p&gt;

\[Revenue = \sum_i NT_i - RT_i + RB_i\]

&lt;p&gt;The new UBI amount paid out to each eligible beneficiary is simply equal to:&lt;/p&gt;

\[UBI = \frac{\it Revenue}{\it NumberOfBeneficiaries}\]

&lt;p&gt;We then adjust the SPM resources of each unit to account for the new UBI payment, as well as the earlier changes made to taxes and benefits. The new SPM resource amount is expressed by the following equation, where n represents the number of eligible UBI beneficiaries in the SPM unit.&lt;/p&gt;

\[NewSPMResources_i = CurrentSPMResources_i + UBI * n_i + RT_i -NT_i - B_i\]

&lt;p&gt;We then assign a new value indicating poverty status for each person belonging to an SPM unit where their new SPM resources are below the Census-provided SPM poverty threshold. We then divide the count of all individuals living under this poverty line by the total population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poverty gap is the sum of the total amount of additional resources required to lift each SPM unit to the SPM poverty threshold. Using our new SPM resources value for each SPM unit i, we calculate the poverty gap with the following formula:&lt;/p&gt;

\[PovertyGap = \sum_i \max(SPMPovertyThreshold_i - NewSPMResources_i, 0)\]

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate Basic Income Builder’s capabilities, we present the results of three different budget-neutral UBI reforms. Each reform provides an equal UBI to child and adult citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first reform, we repeal all six available benefits while holding all else constant; this funds a $64 monthly UBI. To illustrate how our app works in practice, the below screenshot shows the configuration necessary to create this scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-07-21-basic-income-builder/us-calc-results-image-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt_text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this leaves most of the population at least slightly better off, it causes poverty and inequality to increase across all categories, as shown by the simulation results below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-07-21-basic-income-builder/us-calc-results-image-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second reform, we keep all taxes and benefits as is, but apply an additional 1% income tax on top of the existing system. This funds a $31 monthly benefit, but reduces poverty and inequality across all measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-07-21-basic-income-builder/us-calc-results-image-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt_text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our third reform entails a repeal of the existing income tax system (preserving payroll taxes and benefits), replaced with a 25% flat income tax. This funds a $400 monthly UBI while leaving 51% of Americans better off, while reducing poverty overall by 39% and across each demographic group by between 21% and 55%.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate Basic Income Builder’s state-level capabilities, we return to the reform that replaces existing income taxes with a 25% flat income tax, focusing on North Carolina as an example. When selecting North Carolina from the state menu and leaving everything else unchanged, the calculator shows the effect of the federal reform on North Carolina. The UBI amount is the same ($400 per month), but other distributional effects differ, and we can see that North Carolinians come out ahead by an average of $276 per person per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When selecting “State” as the Reform level, the 25% flat income tax instead replaces the North Carolina state income tax. This results in a larger UBI, primarily due to North Carolina’s state income tax raising less revenue than the federal income tax in North Carolina. Consequently, the poverty impacts are substantially greater with this reform, even as it’s no longer a net inflow to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of these scenarios, checking the “Children” and “Non-citizens” boxes reveals that including children and non-citizens in the UBI produces larger poverty and inequality reductions. This aligns with other research, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubicenter.org/how-universal-basic-income-can-keep-poverty-from-rising-amid-covid19&quot;&gt;Ghenis (2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;future-research&quot;&gt;Future research&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aim to improve Basic Income Builder in the future in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Addressing income data deficiencies by incorporating data from the IRS Public Use File&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Addressing benefit deficiencies by imputing unreported benefits with algorithms like PSL’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSLmodels/C-TAM&quot;&gt;CPS Transfer Augmentation Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adjusting for labor supply responses to the changes in the tax code, any effects of repealed benefits on marginal tax rates for low-income individuals, or the income effects of the UBI itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supporting side-by-side comparison of different user specified proposals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Including more tax and benefit reforms on both the federal level, such as repealing deductions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relaxing the requirement for budget-neutrality; instead of determining the UBI amount by changing taxes and benefits, the user could select the desired UBI amount and explore different ways to meet that target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UBI Center Basic Income Builder provides users with access to rapid experimentation and analysis to determine the effects of UBI. Some results are intuitive, such as the regressiveness of replacing benefits with UBI without also raising additional tax revenue, while other results may surprise some audiences, such as the large effects on poverty from even modest taxes—even flat income taxes. We hope that this tool and others like it empower the public to learn more about public policy impacts and that they ultimately produce more evidence-based policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/child-ubi-share">&lt;p&gt;While the idea of a universal basic income has been around for centuries, it was recently brought into mainstream American political discourse by 2020 Presidential candidate Andrew Yang.
Yang centered his campaign around paying every adult citizen $1,000 each month.
Many other countries take the opposite approach, providing monthly &lt;a href=&quot;http://child-allowance.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;“child allowance”&lt;/a&gt; payments for each child, an approach now favored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/6/18249290/child-poverty-american-family-act-sherrod-brown-michael-bennet&quot;&gt;many US lawmakers&lt;/a&gt;.
Here we explore which mix of these two approaches reduces poverty and inequality most effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20200707/adult_child_ubi.html&quot;&gt;July 2020 post&lt;/a&gt;, we found that a child allowance would be more effective at reducing poverty than an adult UBI, for spending levels up to $500 billion, at which point a UBI for both children and adults becomes more effective; adult-only UBI was never the best option.
But those three options—adults only, kids only, and equal for adults and kids—aren’t the only ones available.
In this post, we calculate the optimal ratios of adult to child UBIs, depending on the total spending and objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, we modeled how different UBI amounts (funded by a flat tax on taxable income) would impact the poverty rate if children were excluded, received half the UBI, or received the full benefit.
Our model simulated up until $3 trillion in total UBI spending and found that including children further reduces poverty at every level.
For example, at $1.5 trillion in spending, excluding children would give each adult about $500 a month and reduce the overall poverty rate from 11.7 percent to 4.5 percent.
However, at the same amount of spending, including children in the full benefit would lower the poverty rate to 4 percent, lifting an additional 1.6 million people out of poverty.
Poverty is generally similar between giving children a full-size UBI or half the adult amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the results above only model three scenarios.
In our next simulation, we examined the optimal share of spending that should go to children in order to minimize poverty or reduce inequality.
For each spending level, we simulated 101 scenarios that range from 0 percent of the overall funding going to children to 100 percent.
As a benchmark, we show a line at 22%, which corresponds to equal UBI levels for adults and children (since children comprise 22% of the US population).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest case is inequality reduction, for which optimal policy would give vast majorities of funds to children.
In fact, an annual child allowance should reach over $17,000 per child before any spending goes towards adults.
Even at $3 trillion in new spending, over half of the money would go towards children, resulting in $1,743 a month for kids and $648 per adult.
This is, to some degree, by construction, as our inequality metric considers per-capita resources; other inequality measures may produce different results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the goal is to minimize the poverty rate, the story is a bit more complicated.
For spending levels below $1 trillion, children should receive more than adults; for spending levels above $2 trillion, children should receive less; for spending levels in between, it varies.
Because many people have incomes just below or above their poverty threshold, the poverty rate responds to transfer policy in a volatile way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we examined the effect of UBI design on the  poverty gap, the summation of the distance poor families are from their poverty threshold.
The 2019 poverty gap is $153 billion.
To optimize its reduction, adults should receive more than children at every level above $150 billion in new spending.
With $2 trillion in funding, the poverty gap could be reduced to $45 billion by sending every adult $628 per month and parents $114 per month per child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next chart shows the monthly amount given to children and adults under each optimization (you can hover over points in the prior chart to view this information as well).
Because the poverty gap is less volatile to changes at the margin, the UBI amounts increases are nearly linear. At the highest level of spending in our model, $3 trillion, adults would receive $942 per month and children would receive $171 while optimizing for poverty gap reduction.
Poverty rate amounts are more erratic, while inequality-minimizing amounts are roughly linear with a kink at the point where optimal adult amounts exceed $0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research shows that different policy objectives and funding levels may lead to starkly different amounts of cash transfer funding going towards children.
Each optimization, however, called for children to receive a nonzero share of UBI spending, and often a larger monthly amount than adults, especially with small budgets and when minimizing inequality.
These results underline the importance of including children in UBI conversations and policy analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/racial-poverty-disparities-mlk-day-2021">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is remembered chiefly for his leadership of the civil rights movement,
but toward the end of his life, King extended this leadership to the cause of poverty.
In his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekinglegacy.org/books/where-do-we-go-here-chaos-or-community&quot;&gt;final book&lt;/a&gt;,
he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The time has come for us to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty. […] I’m now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective — the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We honor King’s call by showing how a universal basic income (UBI), funded by a flat income tax, would not only reduce overall poverty, but also shrink the poverty disparities between Black and White people. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:modeling&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:modeling&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black Americans today are 75 percent more likely to be in poverty than White Americans, with a rate of 18.4 percent compared to 10.5 percent.
A $250 monthly UBI would cut both Black and White poverty roughly in half (this is similar to what we found in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/how-universal-basic-income-would-affect-the-black-white-poverty-and-wealth-gaps-452e2af1497b&quot;&gt;July 2020 post&lt;/a&gt;, which used older data and did not simulate taxes to fund the UBI).
A $1,000 monthly UBI funded by a flat income tax would reduce poverty for both White and Black people to about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poverty rate only tells part of the story, though.
When someone goes from deep in poverty to just below the poverty line, the poverty rate is left unchanged, despite the person’s material conditions improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative measure is the &lt;em&gt;poverty gap&lt;/em&gt;, which aggregates each household’s difference between its resources and its poverty threshold. This counts improvements of people who remain in poverty, and can be thought of as the total amount of money required to lift everyone out of poverty, if that money could be perfectly targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying this measure and adjusting for population differences, the Black poverty gap exceeds the White poverty gap by 50 percent: $654 per person, vs. $434 per person.
Given a $250 monthly UBI, which cuts poverty rates in half, poverty gaps also fall by about half, and the difference falls such that the Black poverty gap is about 36 percent higher.
For UBIs above $600 per month, the Black poverty gap even falls below the White poverty gap, likely due to Black people living in areas with lower-cost housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. King didn’t live to see today’s renaissance of guaranteed income, with pandemic responses including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stimulus-check-600-2000-dollars-eligibility-2021-1-1/&quot;&gt;generous unconditional cash transfers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mayorsforagi.org&quot;&gt;mayors across America&lt;/a&gt; calling for pilots, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1316702/nicola-sturgeon-news-scotland-ubi-Universal-Basic-Income-SNP-latest-economy&quot;&gt;leaders across the world&lt;/a&gt; embracing the idea.
But our analysis validates his intuition and the intertwining of his racial justice and economic justice emphases: guaranteed income will produce not only a less impoverished world, but also a less racially disparate one.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Data was gathered from the US Census Bureau’s March Supplement, which covers economic circumstances in 2019. We use the Supplemental Poverty Measure, which incorporates taxes and transfers (including in-kind benefits like SNAP), and adjusts for local housing costs. The flat income tax is applied on positive adjusted gross income. We calculate per-capita poverty gaps by race as the total poverty gap of SPM units with at least one person of that race, divided by the number of people in SPM units with at least one person of that race. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:modeling&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/us-flat-tax">&lt;p&gt;The current US income tax code taxes different types of incomes at different rates, includes an array of credits and deductions that primarily benefit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-tax-deductions-economists-hate/&quot;&gt;upper and middle class&lt;/a&gt;, and requires Americans to spend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/economy082710.pdf&quot;&gt;billions of hours and dollars&lt;/a&gt; filing taxes each year.
A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/06/the-biggest-u-s-tax-breaks/&quot;&gt;2015 Pew survey&lt;/a&gt; found that 66 percent of Republicans and 48 percent of Democrats support completely changing the tax system.
While there are many ways to reform the tax code, a simple way is taxing every dollar at the same rate; this is often called a “flat tax.”
In this paper, we examine the impact of replacing today’s system with a budget-neutral combination of flat income taxes and universal basic incomes (UBIs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;us-flat-tax-simulations&quot;&gt;US flat tax simulations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We simulated the effect of replacing the current federal income tax code and employee side payroll tax with a flat tax over a range of rates.
We allocated any excess revenue to a UBI to make each reform budget-neutral, and filled budget shortfalls with a head tax (equal tax amount per person, essentially a negative UBI). &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:modeling&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:modeling&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flat tax of approximately 18 percent would raise the same amount of revenue as federal income taxes and employee side payroll do today.
Each percentage point of flat tax raises enough revenue to fund a UBI of $360 per year for each adult and child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This replacement would increase the poverty rate by 37 percent, increase the poverty gap (the dollar amount needed to lift everyone above the poverty line) by 23 percent, and increase inequality (as measured by the Gini index of resources per person) by 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining current levels of poverty and inequality requires a higher tax rate to raise funds for a UBI.
A 21 percent flat tax, which would give each person $1,200 per year, would maintain the current poverty gap; a rate and poverty gap; a 22 percent tax giving each person about $1,600 per year would maintain the current poverty rate; a 23 percent tax giving each person about $1,900 would maintain current inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher taxes funding more generous UBIs reduce poverty and inequality to a greater degree.
A flat tax of 30 percent would fund a UBI (including children) of nearly $4,500—cutting poverty in half and inequality by 9 percent.
Going up to 50 percent funds a $1,000 monthly UBI, leaving the poverty rate at a tenth of its currently level and cutting inequality by a third.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows how different flat tax rates up to 50 percent would impact poverty and inequality (the hover function shows the corresponding head tax or UBI for each reform).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the point of the flat tax producing a UBI (18 percent), higher rates lead to more Americans benefiting on a net basis.
Replacing today’s taxes on individual income with a 28 percent flat tax would give each person about $3,700 per year, benefiting the majority of Americans.
The share that come out ahead levels off around 60 percent, with flat taxes of 40 percent or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;generous-transfers-are-the-key-to-inequality-reduction&quot;&gt;Generous transfers are the key to inequality reduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labor markets don’t explain the unusually high level of inequality in the United States, third only to Chile and Mexico among developed countries.
For example, the US has similar “market income” inequality as France, Germany, and Finland—each with Gini indexes of 0.50 to 0.51, as shown in the right bars of this graph from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality&quot;&gt;Our World In Data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/inequality-of-incomes-before-and-after-taxes-and-transfers.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s unusual about the US is how little its government reduces inequality through redistribution.
While France, Germany, and Finland reduce inequality by 0.21, 0.22, and 0.24 on the Gini scale, the US only reduces it by 0.12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What mechanisms do these other countries utilize to cut inequality twice as much as the US?
Counterintuitively, it’s not progressive taxation—the US actually has the most progressive tax code in the OECD,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:progressive-tax&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:progressive-tax&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and tax progressivity does not correlate significantly to inequality reduction (if anything the relationship is slightly negative).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:inequality-data&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:inequality-data&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stronger correlate of inequality reduction is the generosity of public cash transfers.
The countries that distribute a higher share of household income as cash transfers generally cut inequality more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While overall tax levels also significantly correlate with inequality reduction, the effect vanishes when controlling for cash transfers, as shown in column 4 of the regression table below.
Cash transfers are consistently the dominant predictor of the extent to which governments reduce inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;asset6&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cross-country picture aligns with our simulations: larger UBIs cut inequality more, and even if the tax system that funds those larger UBIs isn’t progressive, ability to fund the UBI is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond their simplicity, flat taxes have a number of theoretical advantages.
Progressive tax structures necessarily encourage shifting income from one year to the next as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/105th-congress-1997-1998/reports/marriage.pdf&quot;&gt;marriage, divorce, or both&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:marriage&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:marriage&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Flat taxes treat income neutrally, regardless of when it was earned, by whom, or earners’ family choices.
And because they align marginal tax rates (which determine labor incentives) with effective tax rates (which determine revenue), they raise revenue with relatively little work disincentive.
For example, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w27622&quot;&gt;2020 paper&lt;/a&gt; from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that “a uniform flat tax on capital and labor income combined with a lump-sum transfer is nearly optimal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our simulations and cross-country comparisons show that these advantages don’t need to come at the cost of progressivity; if anything, they may enhance progressivity.
Even a 30 percent flat income tax, with excess revenue distributed as UBI, could cut poverty in half, reduce inequality by 10 percent, and leave most Americans better off.
To achieve the egalitarianism of other developed countries, the US should focus less on progressive taxation, and more on how to raise enough revenue to distribute it broadly, effectively, and generously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:modeling&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We replaced all elements of the personal income tax code, including refundable tax credits, but we retained benefit programs. The analysis is fully static; we did not model changes to labor supply resulting from the changes to marginal tax rates and incomes. We used the Current Population Survey (CPS) March Supplement reflecting income from 2019. The Census Bureau estimates tax liabilities using a microsimulation model, but income and taxes are known to be under-reported in the CPS. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:modeling&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:progressive-tax&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As of 2005, the US had the most progressive tax code of any OECD country according to the concentration index (as shown in the graph), as well as two alternative measures: the ratio of concentration coefficients of household taxes to the Gini index of market income, and the ratio of the richest decile’s tax share to its market income share (&lt;a href=&quot;https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/growing-unequal_9789264044197-en#page108&quot;&gt;Table 4.5&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Growing Unequal?&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:progressive-tax&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:inequality-data&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Data on inequality reduction comes from Our World In Data’s analysis of OECD data reflecting the period 2012 to 2014. Data on the concentration index and income shares of household taxes and cash transfers come from Table 4.6 of the OECD’s 2008 report, &lt;a href=&quot;https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/growing-unequal_9789264044197-en#page109&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Growing Unequal?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which uses data from around 2005. Country population is as of 2014 from the World Bank. Taxes include income taxes and employee social security contributions, not consumption taxes; however, per &lt;a href=&quot;https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/growing-unequal_9789264044197-en#page296&quot;&gt;Figure 11.2&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Growing Unequal?&lt;/em&gt;, consumption taxes have a small effect on relative levels of inequality across OECD countries. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:inequality-data&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:marriage&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Consider, for example, two couples: one with $30,000 earnings each, and another with one earning $60,000 and the spouse earning $0. And consider a progressive tax policy with two rates: 0% (a standard deduction) and 50%. If the standard deduction is $30,000, the first couple has a total tax liability of $15,000 if filing as a couple, but $0 if filing separately—a large marriage bonus (the second couple’s tax liability is $15,000 whether married or separate). If the standard deduction instead varies with marital status, e.g. $15,000 for singles and $30,000 for couples, then the first couple will be treated neutrally, paying $15,000 whether filing separate or married. But now the second couple faces a marriage &lt;em&gt;bonus&lt;/em&gt;, paying $22,500 in taxes if filing separately, but only $15,000  if married. This can be partly remedied by moving to an individualized tax system, as the United Kingdom does, where earnings are taxed independently of a spouse’s earnings. But couples will still have joint assets, and therefore face marriage penalties or bonuses on their capital income if capital income is taxed progressively. Only a flat tax avoids marriage penalties or bonuses. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:marriage&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

Research shows that giving money to families with children, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/6/18249290/child-poverty-american-family-act-sherrod-brown-michael-bennet&quot;&gt;most developed countries do&lt;/a&gt;, reduces each of these issues. A child allowance is a policy that gives families an equal amount for each child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project examines child allowances through various lenses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also review the evidence around child allowances from the United States and Canada, and a special deep dive into research from sub-Saharan Africa, where randomized cash transfer rollouts produce particularly high-quality estimates. For example, cash transfer programs consistently reduced consumption poverty (below). See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/empirical&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;full paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for evidence across other outcomes like education and health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we consider the political state of child allowances, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/american-family-act&quot;&gt;American Family Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would ensure all low-income children in the US receive the full benefits of the Child Tax Credit, and how such a policy would align US child benefits with those from other developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By efficiently reducing child poverty, child allowances provide kids with basic needs, improve access to opportunity, and invest in our future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/child-allowance-state-simulation">&lt;p&gt;Poverty has a lasting impact on children.  Growing up in poverty increases &lt;a href=&quot;https://heckmanequation.org/resource/invest-in-early-childhood-development-reduce-deficits-strengthen-the-economy/&quot;&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://heckmanequation.org/resource/invest-in-early-childhood-development-reduce-deficits-strengthen-the-economy/&quot;&gt;incarceration rates&lt;/a&gt; and decreases &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1876285915003836&quot;&gt;educational&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.2.1.86&quot;&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; outcomes.  These negative consequences not only impact the nation’s poor, but the entire economy as well–child poverty shrinks GDP by more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nap.edu/read/25246/chapter/1&quot;&gt;$1 trillion annually&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that giving money to families with children, as most developed countries do, can reduce each of these issues.  Programs that provide cash to families with children are called a &lt;em&gt;child allowance&lt;/em&gt;, and are typically paid out on a monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can explore the impact of a potential child allowance of various amounts in each state.
We show impacts across three funding mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Federal tax&lt;/strong&gt; as a flat rate on taxable income. For each child allowance amount the total cost is calculated by multiplying the annual child allowance by the total number of children.  To calculate the revenue neutral tax rate, the total cost is divided by the nation’s total taxable income.  For example, a child allowance of $100 per month would cost about $88 billion annually and require a new flat tax of 1.1 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State tax&lt;/strong&gt; as a flat rate on taxable income. The state tax is calculated in the same manner as the federal tax, but at the state level. This shows how states can fund their own child allowances. Because states vary in child population and income, different states have different tax rates. A $100 monthly child allowance in DC is offset by a 0.5 percent tax on taxable income while the same amount requires a 1.3 percent tax in Alabama.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No funding&lt;/strong&gt; does not impose any new taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These static analyses (they do not consider labor supply effects) are based on data from the Current Population Survey March Supplement representing income from 2017 to 2019, and preserve existing benefits such as the Child Tax Credit.&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, the bottom decile would see their average annual resources rise by about $3,700 per person with a federal $300 per month child allowance, while the top 10 percent would see their average resources per person fall by about double, $6,400.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inequality&quot;&gt;Inequality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The progressive benefits by decile demonstrate that child allowances would reduce inequality.
Measures of inequality can formalize this result.
For example, the Gini index lies between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that everyone has the exact same income, and 1 indicating that one person possesses all the income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across funding strategies, child allowances reduce inequality as measured by the Gini index, with larger child allowances producing larger inequality reductions.
Nationally, a $500 monthly child allowance shrinks the Gini index nine percent, from 0.446 to 0.406.
While states vary in their levels of current inequality, a $200 monthly child allowance cuts the measure of inequality consistently between 4 and 5 percent across them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A child allowance can also substantially cut poverty.  In this example, a person is said to be in poverty if their household’s total post tax and transfer income is less than their poverty threshold.
Poverty thresholds are determined by the Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which considers a medley of factors including household size, housing status, and local housing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

But because Black children are currently about twice as likely to be in poverty, it also cuts the percentage-point racial gaps in half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond reducing child poverty, child allowances would decrease adult poverty and abate inequality.
These effects are consistent across states, races, and the funding mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read on to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/empirical&quot;&gt;Empirical studies&lt;/a&gt; page for more research on the (often causal) links between child poverty and outcomes like health, education, and income.

      <title type="html">Student debt cancellation is less progressive than universal payments</title>
      <link href="/student-debt" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Student debt cancellation is less progressive than universal payments" />
      <published>2020-11-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2020-11-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/student-debt</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/student-debt">&lt;p&gt;Over 40 million Americans possess over $1.5 trillion in student debt. And as new borrowers take out loans faster than old borrowers pay them back, that number is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html&quot;&gt;increasing with time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem has led to Democrats across the ideological spectrum to advocate for student debt relief. In the 2020 primary, Bernie Sanders had the most generous &lt;a href=&quot;https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt;, calling for the cancellation of all outstanding student debt regardless of a person’s income. Also in the primary, Elizabeth Warren &lt;a href=&quot;https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/affordable-higher-education&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; cancelling up to $50,000 in student debt, phasing out for households with income above $100,000; in September 2020, she and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000174-9b5b-d59c-a174-df5f0b960000&quot;&gt;introduced a resolution&lt;/a&gt; calling on Biden to cancel $50,000 in debt per person through executive order (the resolution didn’t mention phasing out the cancellation with income).   Back in April, President-elect Joe Biden &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-outlines-new-steps-to-ease-economic-burden-on-working-people-e3e121037322&quot;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; forgiving a minimum of $10,000 of student debt per person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, I analyze which Americans would benefit the most from student debt cancellation and examine how it compares to budget-equivalent universal payments. I find that, across a range of distributional outcomes, each student debt cancellation plan would be less progressive than a universal payment of the same total cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-holds-the-debt&quot;&gt;Who holds the debt?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a caveat: data on student debt is incomplete. The Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) is the primary source of wealth microdata, powering inequality statistics, detailed breakdowns of assets and liabilities, and microsimulations like mine. However, it only counts people in a household’s “Primary Economic Unit,” meaning economically independent young adults living with parents are excluded. As a result, the SCF understates total student debt by about a third, compared to aggregate data sources like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/&quot;&gt;G.19&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/hhdc_2019q4.pdf&quot;&gt;Consumer Credit Panel&lt;/a&gt;. The missing student debt is disproportionately held by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2019/06/27/low-income-people-have-more-student-debt-than-realized/&quot;&gt;young people&lt;/a&gt; and people in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/06/28/who-owes-the-most-student-debt/&quot;&gt;bottom and top income quintiles&lt;/a&gt;. While my colleagues and I aim to refine the data, the SCF is currently the best available source for this sort of analysis, so I use it here while acknowledging its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the 2019 SCF reports $1.1 trillion of total student debt,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:debt&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:debt&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; held by households representing one in four Americans. Some demographics are more likely to hold debt than others:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:hhdemo&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:hhdemo&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Black Americans are the most likely to have student debt, while Hispanic Americans are the least likely, with 33 percent and 18 percent of people possessing student debt respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Young people are more likely to hold student debt than any other age group: 40 percent of people under 35 have student debt compared to just 2 percent of those who are 75 or older.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Income quintiles&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:quintiles&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:quintiles&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; follow a bell curve, with the highest amount of debt held by the middle class and smaller amounts held by the lowest and highest quintile.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Americans living in poverty&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:poverty&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:poverty&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are less likely to possess student debt than Americans living above the poverty line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart below (and others like it included in this paper) allow you to compare the results across race, education level, age groups, income quintiles, net worth quintiles, and poverty status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average person holds about $3,700 in student debt, including those who have no debt at all, with demographic trends similar to the share of households holding debt.  As expected, households headed by college graduates possess the most debt, holding 18 times the amount of debt for those headed by people without a high school diploma (whose student debt is ostensibly held by a spouse or child).  Those at the bottom of the net worth distribution have more student debt than those at the top. This too is unsurprising as younger people hold a disproportionate amount of debt and the student debt itself decreases one’s net worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the 2019 SCF, the Warren-Schumer proposal to cancel $50,000 in student debt would cost approximately $700 billion, or about $2,300 for every adult and child. What if that $2,300 was given directly as a universal payment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, groups that would receive more money from student debt cancellation include the top two income quintiles, Black Americans, college graduates, and people not in poverty; other groups would receive more from the universal payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancelling $50,000 in student debt would lift more Americans out of total debt (negative net worth) than a budget-equivalent universal payment.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:static&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:static&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In total, the student debt cancellation would reduce the number of Americans in debt by 44 percent while the universal payment plan would reduce it by 30 percent. This overall trend is mostly consistent across demographic groups. Exceptions include Hispanics, people with no education beyond high school, people at the bottom quintile of the income distribution, and those living in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inequality-impacts&quot;&gt;Inequality impacts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For income inequality (and poverty), I follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://finaid.org/loans/forgivenesstaxability&quot;&gt;IRS guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in treating student loan forgiveness as income, though I do not estimate its tax liability. I calculate inequality using the Gini index, which goes from zero (perfect equality) to one (one person holds all the income/wealth). Student debt forgiveness reduces wealth inequality slightly more than a budget equivalent-universal payment; however, universal payments reduce income inequality more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across every demographic and metric, universal payments would cut poverty rates at a higher rate than student debt cancellation. Overall, universal payments would cut poverty by 52 percent, while cancelling $50,000 in student debt would cut poverty by 14 percent. Hispanic and Black poverty would fall 63 percent and 47 percent under universal payments, respectively, but only 7 percent and 11 percent under student debt cancellation. Student debt cancellation would cut poverty for people in households headed by people without a high school diploma by 1 percent, while universal payments would cut it by 46 percent. Universal payments would even eliminate poverty for Americans in the second income quintile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparing-other-student-debt-proposals&quot;&gt;Comparing other student debt proposals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this paper focuses on comparing the $50,000 forgiveness currently proposed by Senators Warren and Schumer, I found similar results comparing other proposals. Whether comparing full forgiveness to a budget-equivalent universal payment of $3,650, or Warren’s phased-out $50,000 forgiveness to $2,100 payments, or $10,000 forgiveness to $770 payments, universal payments benefit a larger share of Americans and reduce poverty and income inequality by a larger amount, while student debt cancellation reduces wealth inequality more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;asset13&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the majority of Americans do not have student debt, the majority of Americans will not benefit from student debt cancellation, no matter the size of the proposal.  Student debt cancellation primarily benefits high income earners with a college degree, a demographic &lt;a href=&quot;https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/research/what-you-make-depends-on-where-you-live&quot;&gt;likely to see incomes rise over time&lt;/a&gt;, while leaving out some of the poorest Americans. Still, Senator Warren and other proponents correctly identify it as a way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RI_StudentDebtForgiveness_WorkingPaper_202008.pdf&quot;&gt;cut inequality and the racial wealth gap&lt;/a&gt;. Student debt has reached enormous levels, making its cancellation a major program that would benefit tens of millions, and among degree holders, it would disproportionately benefit those from less-advantaged backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the enormity of the endeavor justifies careful comparison to other policies. While student debt cancellation reduces wealth inequality more than universal payments, it mostly underperforms simply sending every American a check on reducing racial wealth gaps. On all other outcomes, it fares even worse: universal payments would reduce poverty and income inequality more than student debt cancellation, regardless of the particular policy design. This analysis may even understate the relative progressivity of universal payments, given it doesn’t capitalize the higher future incomes associated with college education (though limitations of the SCF data may counter that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Means-testing the student debt cancellation closes some of the gap, but introduces its own challenges. Warren’s proposal is effectively a retroactive additional marginal tax of 33 percent on student debtors’ earnings between $100,000 and $250,000. This would make this group some of the most highly taxed in the country, with total marginal tax rates likely exceeding 70 percent after considering state and federal income and payroll taxes (only &lt;a href=&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/aspe-files/260661/brief2-overviewmtranalyses.pdf&quot;&gt;low-income benefit recipients&lt;/a&gt; would face higher marginal taxes). Retroactive taxation may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42791.pdf&quot;&gt;constitutional&lt;/a&gt;, but it arguably &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/law360-oped-on-retroactive-taxation-003.pdf&quot;&gt;threatens rule of law&lt;/a&gt;; people value knowing the payoff to their labor when making decisions about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universal payments have less quantifiable advantages, as well. A one-time debt cancellation excludes both people who recently paid off their student loans, and those about to incur it; universal payments reach all. By favoring college graduates over non-college graduates, student debt cancellation threatens to exacerbate political tensions between these demographics that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/research/2020-exit-polls-show-a-scrambling-of-democrats-and-republicans-traditional-bases/&quot;&gt;only rose in the 2020 election&lt;/a&gt;. If young people expect future rounds of student debt cancellation, they may also choose to take on more debt, which could in turn &lt;a href=&quot;http://taylornadauld.com/research/published_papers/Credit%20Supply%20and%20the%20Rise%20in%20College%20Tuition.pdf&quot;&gt;raise the cost of higher education&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While student debt cancellation makes progress toward egalitarian goals (and may have the advantage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Ltr%20to%20Warren%20re%20admin%20debt%20cancellation.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3x7goUzVOpD7vcp7XhPYPlYQPmzv7rTzfNIvwl9Y8claLM0p7fo017N-g&quot;&gt;skipping congressional approval&lt;/a&gt;), dollar-for-dollar, those goals are better achieved through universal payments.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html&quot;&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; total student debt to be $1.54 trillion as of the second quarter of 2020. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:debt&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:hhdemo&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Because the SCF collects data at the household level, all demographics are represented by the demographic of the head of household. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:hhdemo&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:quintiles&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I assign households to income and net worth quintiles based on per-capita income and net worth, respectively, weighted by person such that each quintile has the same population. Inequality statistics are also based on per-capita income and net worth and weighted by person. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:quintiles&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:poverty&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I classify a household as in poverty if its official &lt;a href=&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/2019-poverty-guidelines&quot;&gt;2019 poverty guideline&lt;/a&gt; (defined by Health and Human Services) exceeds its total income (including in-kind benefits like food assistance, and in this case, student loan forgiveness). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:poverty&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:static&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Calculations around net debt and other outcomes assume that all cancelled debt and universal payments go directly to net worth; that is, consumption is assumed to be constant. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:static&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <updated>2020-11-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/veterans</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/veterans">&lt;p&gt;Today we honor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/vetdata/veteran_population.asp&quot;&gt;over 19 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; who have served in the military, of whom one in 13 is in poverty. This is a third lower than the poverty rate among non-Veterans, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/12/09/veteran-households-in-u-s-are-economically-better-off-than-those-of-non-veterans/&quot;&gt;higher incomes&lt;/a&gt; and Veteran benefits, but still amounts to over 1.4 million people who lack resources to cover basic needs. Universal basic income would help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing assistance programs cut Veteran poverty substantially. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbpp.org/blog/veterans-and-the-safety-net-0&quot;&gt;Two million Veterans&lt;/a&gt; receive refundable tax credits—the Earned Income Tax Credit and the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit—and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/snap-helps-13-million-low-income-veterans-including-thousands-in-every&quot;&gt;1.3 million&lt;/a&gt; receive SNAP (formerly food stamps). Certain veteran households are also eligible to receive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/pension/veterans-pension-rates/&quot;&gt;up to $36,387&lt;/a&gt; per year through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/pension/eligibility/&quot;&gt;Veterans Pension&lt;/a&gt; program, depending on their household size, income, net worth, age, service period, and disability status. Veterans with disabilities related to their active-duty service can also receive up to $44,208 per year, depending on their household size and severity of their disability through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/disability/compensation-rates/veteran-rates/&quot;&gt;Veterans Disability Compensation&lt;/a&gt; program. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://benefits.va.gov/benefits/&quot;&gt;Veterans Benefit Administration&lt;/a&gt; provides a number of other benefits around health, education, and other areas, especially for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benefits.va.gov/persona/veteran-elderly.asp&quot;&gt;elderly Veterans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet these programs fail to reach all Veterans in need. As the Department of Veterans Affairs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/vetdata/docs/specialreports/veteran_poverty_trends.pdf&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, veterans with disabilities have a higher official poverty rate than non-veterans with disabilities for all age groups except over age 65, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/vetdata/docs/Quickfacts/VA_Utilization_Profile_2017.pdf&quot;&gt;half of Veterans&lt;/a&gt; don’t use VA programs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/43-point-3-percent-of-veterans-with-a-service-connected-disability-were-employed-in-august-2015.htm#:~:text=Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics,-The%20Economics%20Daily&amp;amp;text=In%20August%202015%2C%20about%204.3,all%20veterans%20was%2047.8%20percent.&quot;&gt;20 percent of Veterans&lt;/a&gt; have a service-connected disability, and as we &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20200731/ada30.html&quot;&gt;wrote in July&lt;/a&gt;, one in five people with disabilities is in poverty—nearly double the rate of people without disabilities. In that analysis, we also showed that a $300-per-month universal basic income (UBI) would halve poverty among people with disabilities. What would UBI do for all Veterans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this analysis, we modeled a UBI funded by a flat tax on adjusted gross income (AGI). In this model, every $100 monthly UBI requires a 3.3 percent tax on AGI. To fund a $300-per-month UBI, the federal government would have to levy a 9.8 percent tax. But like we found in the disability analysis, this would also reduce Veteran poverty by half. Poverty among children in Veteran households would be cut by 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that reducing Veteran poverty could address issues disproportionately experienced by Veterans. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_19_163&quot;&gt;Over 37,000 Veterans&lt;/a&gt; experience homelessness on a given night, and a recent experiment in Canada found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://forsocialchange.org/our-story&quot;&gt;cash transfers accelerated&lt;/a&gt; transitions out of homelessness. Veterans have a higher rate of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4638236/&quot;&gt;mental illness&lt;/a&gt;, especially depression, PTSD, and substance abuse disorder, while Finland’s UBI experiment &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheUBICenter/status/1258064957406511104&quot;&gt;improved mental health&lt;/a&gt;. Controlling for age and sex, the Veteran suicide rate exceeds the non-Veteran suicide rate by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/data-sheets/2019/2019_National_Veteran_Suicide_Prevention_Annual_Report_508.pdf&quot;&gt;50 percent&lt;/a&gt;, and a review of cash transfer programs in low- and middle-income countries found &lt;a href=&quot;https://mbrg.bsg.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-05/the_role_of_cash_transfers_in_preventing_suicides_in_lmics_1.pdf&quot;&gt;significant suicide reductions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique Veteran experience warrants investment in tailored solutions, such as the health and education programs offered by the VA. Cash transfers like universal basic income can also reduce their incidence of poverty and empower them to meet their individual needs. Even modest basic incomes such as a tax-funded $300 per month would halve Veteran poverty and more than halve poverty among children of Veterans, improving poverty-linked outcomes for those who have served.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
